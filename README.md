# Earthquakes prediction
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of methods for earthquake prediction at a global scale.

## Requirements:

1.  PyTorch

2. lie_learn library

## data and result
1. in data file, one can test the performance using the testdate by validate.py

2. result file has the result in csv.


## Note:
The file is limited within 25Mb by github. If needed, one can contact the author for result (model file in pth) and train and test data.The trainedn model in pth format file can be obtained: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1eOyaOikQLBcSVAQ0jsu9ig with password 1234.
